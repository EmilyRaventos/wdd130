      I'm majoring in Software Engineering. I just switched over to this major
      so I don't know much... yet. I currently work as a Software Tester
      (Quality Assurance) for an online company in Utah. It's been a fun job and
      I'm excited to continue learning more about this field.

      Some of my hobbies are boxing, Jiu-Jitsu, hiking, and reading. I love
      trying new things! I just started learning Jiu-jitsu last semester at the
      club they have on campus (10/10 would recommend). I also love sports like
      spikeball, pickleball, basketball, and volleyball but am seriously
      terrible at all of them!

      I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my
      whole life and served a mission in Wisconsin. I'm sure you've heard this
      from all return missionaries, but I love love love the people there so
      much! And the cheese. One of my favorite quotes from Elder Christofferson
      is "The very details of our lives are of interest to God. He cares about
      all of it - words, works, even thoughts. His interest and love are
      infinite in this way, and He will respond to our hopes and pleadings and
      help us in everything, including matters that seem unimportant or
      insignificant to others or even to oursleves."
