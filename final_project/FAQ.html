        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <h6>Do you do commissions?</h6>
        <p>
          I do! I have a commission request form that automatically puts your
          response onto a waitlist. That way, I can make my way through each one
          in the order I receive them. At the moment, my waitlist is closed
          until I finish my last round.
        </p>

        <h6>How many OCs do you have?</h6>
        <p>
          I have 6 original characters in the prequel era (Tara, Ohmal, Sarai,
          Verina, Commander Rais, and LEnal) and 4 in the original trilogy ero
          (Solvi, Manuwey, Todirey, and Alvana).
        </p>

        <h6>What do you use to make art?</h6>
        <p>I use procreate on an iPad Pro 12.9" and an Apple pencil 2nd gen</p>

        <h6>What canvas specs do you use when drawing?</h6>
        <p>
          80% of my artworks are done using 3000px x 3000px with 600dpi on
          Procreate.
        </p>

        <h6>When did you first start making art?</h6>
        <p>
          I've been doing traditional art since I was a kid, as long as I can
          remember! I've always loved pencil sketching, acrylic and watercolor
          painting, and scultping. However, I tried digital art for the first
          time in the summer of 2020.
        </p>

        <h6>What are you doing in life right now?</h6>
        <p>
          I'm currently a student attending a university in Idaho and doing art
          on the side. I am a Political Science major with an emphasis in
          foreign affairs and I love it! I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's
          degree in the spring of 2024 and take up art and writing as my main
          career while using my degree to help with the refugee programs in
          Utah.
        </p>

        <h6>Do you make art for other fandoms besides Star Wars?</h6>
        <p>
          I'll occasionally draw for other fandoms (I've done art for the Six of
          Crows, Harry Potter, ATLA, etc.) but at the moment my main niche is in
          Star Wars so that's what I post on here most of the time.
        </p>

        <h6>How can I support you if I can't afford a commission?</h6>
        <p>
          I appreciate any and all support I receive on here! Aside from liking,
          sharing/following/commenting on posts (which is super helpful by the
          way!) I also have a Ko-fi if you'd like to donate a small amount! My
          username there is also @kyjoraven.
        </p>

        <h6>What's your favorite Star Wars movie?</h6>
        <p>
          Depending on the day, my favorite switches between Revenge of the
          Sith, the Empire Strikes Back, and Rouge One. :)
