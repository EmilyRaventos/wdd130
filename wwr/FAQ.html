          <h4>Why Rafting?</h4>
          <h5>What are benefits of white water rafting?</h5>
          <p>
            White water rafting offers a variety of benefits! It can be an
            intense cardio work out and an adrenaline filled experience. It can
            also be a great way to see beautiful sites with friends and family.
            And don't forget it's fun!
          </p>
          <h5>How many people fit on a raft?</h5>
          <p>
            Our rafts vary in size to help you find the best fit for your group!
            We have a large raft that can hold 12 people, the regular raft will
            hold eight, and the smaller raft holds four.
          </p>

          <h4>Preparation</h4>
          <h5>What should I wear</h5>
          <p>
            Be comfortable! Swimwear and comfortable footwear are recommended.
            Other items you might want to bring include: hats, sunglasses, and
            sunscreen.
          </p>

          <h5>What should I bring?</h5>
          <p>
            We will provide the necessary supplies for you to participate in
            your rafting adventure! You're welcome to bring water, snacks,
            cameras and weather appropriate clothing in addition to what we
            provide.
          </p>

          <h5>How long will I be rafting?</h5>
          <p>
            The duration of the trip depends completely on the river you choose.
            Contact us to find out details of a specific river.
          </p>

          <h4>Safety</h4>
          <h5>Do I need to have experience rafting?</h5>
          <p>
            First time rafters are welcome! We have many different locations for
            rafters of all experience levels.
          </p>

          <h5>Do I need to know how to swim?</h5>
          <p>
            No, you don't need to know how to swim to enjoy white water rafting.
            While knowing how to swim may be helpful, you will be wearing life
            preservers and have an experienced guide with you to minimize any
            risks!

            Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows, canyons, and
            high peaks; it's way more than just the rapids. It's a great way to
            get away from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of the great
            outdoors. - Rafter 1
